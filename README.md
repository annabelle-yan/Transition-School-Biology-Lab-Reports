TRANSITION SCHOOL BIOLOGY LAB REPORTS

In the following lab reports, I discuss multiple experiments I have conducted over fall and winter quarter in TS Biology's lab sections. 
I have explored the mechanisms of polymerase chain reaction, gel electrophoresis, Mendelian genetics, phenylthiocarbamide tasting, and the lac operon through hands-on experiments.

Genetics Lab Report: In this lab report, my lab group and I grew Brassica rapa plants with different genotypes from different generations, observed their subsequent phenotypes, and examined whether their emergent phenotypes for height and color matched predictions made with Punnett squares. 

PTC Lab Report: This report explores the relationship between a person's geographic place of origin and their PTC tasting gene by matching previous maps of PTC-tasting frequency around the world with the small sample of our class. My class conducted an experiment to determine the genotypes and phenotypes of this sample population by testing whether a student was a strong taster (TT), a weak taster (Tt), or a non-taster (tt). We used PCR, a digestion enzyme, and gel electrophoresis, and then compared phenotypic results with the published map.

PCR and Gel Lab Report: In this report, my lab group and I isolated DNA samples from dirt, leaves, and face swabs, extracted and purified their DNA, performed PCR to amplify the DNA, and conducted gel electrophoresis to determine whether the samples we collected had bacteria or mold. We concluded that the leaf had mold cells present on its surface, while both the soil and leaf samples had bacteria cells present.

Lac Operon Lab Report: With this lab report, I was familiarized with gene regulation through using the lac operon as a model. Through series of experiments we recognized that the operon only produces the digestive enzyme beta galactosidase when lactose is present and glucose is absent.
